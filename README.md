# Calories-Burnt-Prediction
* In this project we are trying to find out the impact of Duration of workout, Height,Weight and Age on the amount of calories Burnt.
* Since the amount of calories burnt would be a continuous value, we can consider this as Regression Problem 
* Also  since the target is also well defined this comes under Supervised Machine Learning.
* For this project we have used four models namely Linear Regression,Decision Tree Regressor,Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost Regressor.
* From the four models above,Random Forest performed the best.The Models were evaluated on two metrics : Mean Square Error(MSE) and R2 Score
